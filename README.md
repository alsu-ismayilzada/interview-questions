1. What is Java?
Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language that is widely used for 
developing a variety of applications, including web, desktop, and mobile applications.
2. What is the difference between Java and JavaScript?
Java and JavaScript are two different programming languages with different purposes. 
Java is used for building applications, while JavaScript is primarily used for adding 
interactivity to web pages.
3. What is the main principle of Java programming?
Java follows the principle of "write once, run anywhere" (WORA), which means that Java 
code can be compiled into bytecode and executed on any platform that has a Java 
Virtual Machine (JVM).
4. What are the main features of Java?
Some of the main features of Java include platform independence, object-oriented 
programming, automatic memory management (garbage collection), and strong type 
checking.
5. What is a class in Java?
In Java, a class is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines the properties 
(attributes) and behaviors (methods) that objects of that class can have.
6. What is an object in Java?
An object in Java is an instance of a class. It represents a specific entity or item that can 
have its own set of attributes and behaviors defined by its class.
7. What is a method in Java?
A method in Java is a block of code that performs a specific task. It can be called or 
invoked to execute its defined functionality.
8. What is the difference between a class and an object?
A class is a blueprint or template, while an object is an instance of that class. A class 
defines the structure and behavior of objects, while objects represent specific instances 
of the class.
9. What is inheritance in Java?
Inheritance is a mechanism in Java where a class can inherit properties and behaviors 
from another class. It allows for code reuse and creating a hierarchical relationship 
between classes.
10. What are the types of inheritance in Java?
Java supports single inheritance, where a class can inherit from only one superclass, and 
multiple inheritance through interfaces, where a class can implement multiple 
interfaces.
11. What is polymorphism in Java?
Polymorphism is the ability of an object to take on many forms. In Java, it allows objects 
of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass, enabling code 
flexibility and reusability.
12. What are the access modifiers in Java?
Java provides four access modifiers: public, private, protected, and default (no modifier). 
They control the visibility and accessibility of classes, methods, and variables.
13. What is encapsulation in Java?
Encapsulation is the process of hiding internal details and providing a public interface to 
interact with an object. It helps in achieving data abstraction and protects data from 


unauthorized access.
14. What is a constructor in Java?
A constructor in Java is a special method that is used to initialize objects of a class. It is 
called automatically when an object is created and has the same name as the class.
15. What is the difference between a constructor and a method?
A constructor is a special method used for object initialization and is called 
automatically when an object is created. A method, on the other hand, is a block of code 
that performs a specific task and needs to be called explicitly.
16. What is the Java Virtual Machine (JVM)?
The JVM is a crucial part of the Java platform. It is responsible for executing Java 
bytecode and provides a runtime environment in which Java programs can run on any 
hardware or operating system.
17. What is the Java Development Kit (JDK)?
The JDK is a software development kit provided by Oracle, which includes the necessary 
tools and libraries to develop, compile, and run Java programs. It consists of the JVM, 
compiler, and other utilities.
18. What is the difference between the JDK and the JRE?
The JDK (Java Development Kit) is a software development kit that includes the tools 
needed to develop Java applications, while the JRE (Java Runtime Environment) is a 
runtime environment required to run Java applications.
19. What is a package in Java?
A package in Java is a way of organizing related classes and interfaces. It provides a 
namespace and helps in avoiding naming conflicts.
20. What is the difference between an abstract class and an interface?
An abstract class can have both abstract and non-abstract methods and can be 
extended by other classes, while an interface only contains abstract method 
declarations and can be implemented by classes.


21. What is a static method in Java?
A static method in Java is a method that belongs to the class rather than an instance of 
the class. It can be called without creating an object of the class.
22. What is the keyword "final" used for in Java?
The "final" keyword in Java can be used to declare a variable, a method, or a class. A final 
variable cannot be changed, a final method cannot be overridden, and a final class 
cannot be inherited.
23. What is method overloading in Java?
Method overloading is the ability to define multiple methods with the same name but 
different parameters in the same class. The appropriate method is called based on the 
arguments passed.
24. What is method overriding in Java?
Method overriding is the ability to provide a different implementation of a method in a 
subclass that is already defined in its superclass. It allows for the execution of the 
overridden method instead of the superclass method.
25. What is the difference between method overloading and method overriding?
Method overloading involves defining multiple methods with the same name but 
different parameters in the same class, while method overriding involves providing a 
different implementation of a method in a subclass that is already defined in its 
superclass.
26. What is the "this" keyword in Java?
The "this" keyword in Java refers to the current instance of a class. It can be used to 
access instance variables, call instance methods, or invoke constructors.
27. What is a static variable in Java?
A static variable in Java is a variable that belongs to the class rather than an instance of 
the class. It is shared among all instances of the class.
28. What is the purpose of the "final" keyword in method parameters?


The "final" keyword in method parameters is used to make the parameter value 
unchangeable within the method. It ensures that the parameter cannot be reassigned or 
modified.
29. What is the purpose of the "static" keyword in Java?
The "static" keyword in Java is used to declare variables, methods, and nested classes 
that belong to the class itself, rather than instances of the class. It allows accessing them 
without creating an object of the class.
30. What is the difference between "==" and ".equals()" in Java?
The "==" operator in Java is used to compare the equality of object references, while the 
".equals()" method is used to compare the equality of object values. The ".equals()" 
method can be overridden to provide custom equality comparison.
31. What is the purpose of the "super" keyword in Java?
The "super" keyword in Java is used to refer to the superclass of a class. It can be used to 
access superclass members, invoke superclass constructors, or differentiate between 
superclass and subclass members with the same name.
32. What is a thread in Java?
A thread in Java is a lightweight unit of execution within a program. It allows concurrent 
execution of multiple tasks or activities, enabling better utilization of system resources.
33. How do you create and start a thread in Java?
To create and start a thread in Java, you can either extend the "Thread" class and 
override the "run()" method, or implement the "Runnable" interface and pass it to a new 
"Thread" object. Then call the "start()" method on the thread object to begin execution.
34. What is synchronization in Java?
Synchronization in Java is a technique used to control the access and execution of 
multiple threads to ensure that only one thread can access a shared resource or code 
block at a time.
35. What is the difference between the "synchronized" block and the "synchronized" 
method?


A "synchronized" block in Java allows a specific block of code to be synchronized, 
ensuring that only one thread can execute it at a time. A "synchronized" method applies 
synchronization to the entire method, making it mutually exclusive for all threads.
36. What is the purpose of the "volatile" keyword in Java?
The "volatile" keyword in Java is used to indicate that a variable's value may be modified 
by multiple threads. It ensures that any read or write operation on the variable is directly 
performed on the main memory, rather than relying on CPU caches.
37. What is an exception in Java?
An exception in Java is an event that occurs during the execution of a program, which 
disrupts the normal flow of instructions. It represents an error condition or an exceptional 
circumstance.
38. What is the difference between checked and unchecked exceptions?
Checked exceptions are checked at compile-time, and the programmer is required to 
handle or declare them using the "throws" keyword. Unchecked exceptions, on the other 
hand, are not checked at compile-time, and the programmer is not obligated to handle 
or declare them.
39. How do you handle exceptions in Java?
Exceptions in Java can be handled using try-catch blocks. The code that may throw an 
exception is placed inside the try block, and if an exception occurs, it is caught and 
handled in the catch block.
40. What is the purpose of the "finally" block in exception handling?
The "finally" block in Java is used to define a block of code that will be executed 
regardless of whether an exception occurs or not. It is often used to release resources or 
perform cleanup operations.
41. What is the difference between the "throw" and "throws" keywords in Java?
The "throw" keyword in Java is used to manually throw an exception, while the "throws" 
keyword is used in method declarations to specify that the method may throw certain 
types of exceptions.


42. What is the difference between checked exceptions and runtime exceptions?
Checked exceptions are checked at compile-time and must be handled or declared, 
while runtime exceptions (unchecked exceptions) are not required to be handled or 
declared.
43. What is the Java API?
The Java API (Application Programming Interface) is a collection of classes, interfaces, 
and other resources provided by the Java Development Kit (JDK). It provides a set of 
predefined classes and methods for building Java applications.
44. What is the difference between an ArrayList and a LinkedList?
An ArrayList is implemented as a resizable array, allowing fast random access but slower 
insertion and removal of elements. A LinkedList is implemented as a doubly-linked list, 
allowing fast insertion and removal but slower random access.
45. What is the difference between a HashSet and a TreeSet?
A HashSet in Java stores elements in no particular order, using a hash table for fast 
access but does not maintain any specific order. A TreeSet stores elements in sorted 
order and allows for efficient retrieval of elements based on their natural ordering or a 
custom comparator.
46. What is the difference between the "equals()" method and the "hashCode()" 
method?
The "equals()" method is used to compare the equality of objects based on their values, 
while the "hashCode()" method is used to calculate a unique hash code value for an 
object, typically used for efficient retrieval in hash-based data structures like HashMaps.
47. What is the difference between a shallow copy and a deep copy?
A shallow copy creates a new object that shares the same references as the original 
object, while a deep copy creates a new object and recursively copies all the referenced 
objects as well, resulting in separate copies.
48. What is a lambda expression in Java?


A lambda expression in Java is an anonymous function that can be used to simplify the 
syntax of functional interfaces. It allows for more concise and readable code, especially 
when working with functional programming constructs.
49. What is functional programming in Java?

programs using pure functions and immutable data. It involves treating functions as 
first-class citizens and utilizing higher-order functions and lambda expressions.
50. What are the Java 8 features for functional programming?
Java 8 introduced several features to support functional programming, including 
lambda expressions, functional interfaces, the Stream API for working with collections, 
and default methods in interfaces.
51. What is the difference between an interface and an abstract class?
An interface in Java can only declare method signatures and constants but cannot 
provide implementations, while an abstract class can have both method declarations 
and concrete implementations. A class can implement multiple interfaces but can 
inherit from only one abstract class.
52. What is the purpose of the "default" keyword in interface methods?
The "default" keyword in Java interfaces is used to define a default implementation for a 
method. It allows adding new methods to existing interfaces without breaking the 
implementations of classes that implement those interfaces.
53. What is the difference between a BufferedReader and a Scanner?
A BufferedReader in Java reads text from a character stream with efficient buffering, 
while a Scanner can parse different types of data from various sources such as files, 
strings, or standard input.
54. What is the purpose of the "StringBuilder" class in Java?
The "StringBuilder" class in Java is used to create and manipulate mutable sequences of 
characters. It is more efficient than concatenating strings using the "+" operator, as it 
avoids unnecessary object creations.


55. What is the difference between the "Comparable" and "Comparator" interfaces?
The "Comparable" interface is used to define a natural ordering for a class by 
implementing the "compareTo()" method. The "Comparator" interface, on the other 
hand, provides a way to define custom ordering by implementing the "compare()" 
method and is independent of the class being compared.
56. What is the purpose of the "assert" keyword in Java?
The "assert" keyword in Java is used to perform assertions, which are checks placed in 
the code to verify specific conditions. It is primarily used during development and testing 
to catch potential bugs or invalid assumptions.
57. What is the difference between a local variable and an instance variable?
A local variable in Java is declared inside a method or a block and has a limited scope 
within that method or block. An instance variable, also known as a member variable, is 
declared within a class but outside any method and is accessible to all methods of the 
class.
58. What is the purpose of the "transient" keyword in Java?
The "transient" keyword in Java is used to indicate that a variable should not be 
serialized during object serialization. When an object is deserialized, transient variables 
are set to their default values.
59. What is the purpose of the "static" block in Java?
The "static" block in Java is used to initialize static variables or perform one-time 
initialization tasks for a class. It is executed when the class is loaded into memory, before 
any objects of that class are created.
60. What is the purpose of the "strictfp" keyword in Java?
The "strictfp" keyword in Java is used to ensure strict adherence to the IEEE 754 standard 
for floating-point calculations. It ensures consistent results across different platforms by 
disabling some optimizations that can affect precision.

A public class in Java can be accessed from any other class, regardless of the package 
they belong to. A default class, also known as a package-private class, is only accessible 
within the same package and cannot be accessed from outside the package.
62. What is the purpose of the "enum" keyword in Java?
The "enum" keyword in Java is used to define an enumeration, which is a special type 
that represents a fixed set of constants. It allows for more structured and type-safe 
representation of predefined values.

The "break" statement in Java is used to terminate the execution of a loop or switch 
statement and resume execution after the loop or switch block. The "continue" statement 
is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration.
64. What is the purpose of the "try-with-resources" statement in Java?
The "try-with-resources" statement in Java is used to automatically close resources that 
implement the "AutoCloseable" interface. It ensures that resources, such as file streams 
or database connections, are properly closed, even if an exception occurs.
65. What is the purpose of the "instanceof" operator in Java?
The "instanceof" operator in Java is used to check whether an object is an instance of a 
specific class or implements a specific interface. It returns a boolean value indicating the 
result of the check.
66. What is the difference between the pre-increment and post-increment operators?
The pre-increment operator (++i) in Java increments the value of a variable and returns 
the incremented value, while the post-increment operator (i++) increments the value of 
a variable but returns the original value before the increment.
67. What is the difference between the pre-decrement and post-decrement operators?
The pre-decrement operator (--i) in Java decrements the value of a variable and 
returns the decremented value, while the post-decrement operator (i--) decrements the 
value of a variable but returns the original value before the decrement.
